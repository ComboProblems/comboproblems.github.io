      <p>I earned a <em>BA in Mathematics</em> from <strong>Whittier College</strong> in May 2014 and an <em>MS in Mathematics</em> from the <strong>University of Texas Rio Grande Valley</strong> in December 2018. From 2014 until 2016, I was a
        <em>Denver Math Fellow</em> at <strong>DCIS Montbello</strong> as a part of an <strong>Americorps</strong> grant doing small group instruction and math intervention for 9th graders.

      <h2 class="research-subsection">Research Intrests</h2>
      <p class="research-description"> Broadly speaking I am intrested in <strong>enumerative combinatorics</strong>, <strong>number theory</strong>, and the <strong>application of computers</strong> to these areas. </p>
      <p> I've written several papers concerning $p (n,m)$, the function which enumerates integer partitions of $n$ into at most $m$ parts. These papers work on exploring number theoretic, combinatorial, geometric, and algebraic properties of $p
        (n,m)$. </p>
